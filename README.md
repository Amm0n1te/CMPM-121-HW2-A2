# CMPM-121-HW2-A2

For this project, I created 
- Point Lights (in the red and green lamps)
> A Directional Light to cast some shadows
> Some spotlights to illuminate the silent film text screens
> emmissive materials on the starshower particle system and the lamps
> a UI button (L) to toggle the lights from full to dim to off 
> A 2d Texture emmiter particle system (the starshowers)
